# Walysson Santos - My resume on AWS
## About This Project 
This is my Cloud Resume Project, built entirely on AWS Cloud. The project features a static website hosted in an AWS S3 bucket, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I utilized Route 53 to manage the domain name, ACM to secure the site with SSL/TLS certificates, and CloudFront for fast content delivery, with automatic redirection of HTTP traffic to HTTPS for enhanced security.Additionally, I implemented a visitor counter using AWS Lambda functions, written in Python.

Below is my project architecture overview:
